When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

### IAM roles

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles allow customers to assign granular access policies and permissions to services and users on the AWS Cloud. This solution creates IAM roles that grant the solutionâ€™s access between the solution components.

### Security groups

The security groups created in this solution are designed to control and isolate network traffic between the solution components. We recommend that you review the security groups and further restrict access as needed once the deployment is up and running.
