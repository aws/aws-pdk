Amazon Lookout for Metrics automatically inspects and prepares the data from these sources to detect anomalies with greater speed and accuracy than traditional methods used for anomaly detection. You can also provide feedback on detected anomalies to tune the results and improve accuracy over time. Amazon Lookout for Metrics makes it easy to diagnose detected anomalies by grouping together anomalies that are related to the same event and sending an alert that includes a summary of the potential root cause. It also ranks anomalies in order of severity so that you can prioritize your attention to what matters the most to your business.",

AWS MDC reduces the time and resources it takes for customers to deploy data centers in remote environments with limited infrastructure. Customers can proactively monitor and manage their modular data centers using a management system that comes with every MDC. Each modular data center is equipped with Building Management System (BMS) sensors to monitor the environmental conditions of the MDC including temperature, humidity, ventilation, HVAC performance, and power quality. The BMS also monitors the life safety systems, such as smoke detection, fire alarm, and the Access Control (ACS) / Intrusion Detection System (IDS).",
