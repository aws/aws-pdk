## PDK Nag

PDKNag ships with a helper utility that automatically configures CDKNag within your application.

```ts
const app = PDKNag.app();
const stack = new Stack(app, 'MyStack');
...
```

As shown above, this will configure your application to have CDKNag run on synthesis.

By default, CDK will trigger a failure on `synth` if any errors are encountered. To relax these, run the following:

```shell
cdk synth --ignore-errors
```

Conversely, CDK will not fail on synth if warnings are detected. To enforce that all warnings are resolved, run the following command:

```shell
cdk synth --strict
```
