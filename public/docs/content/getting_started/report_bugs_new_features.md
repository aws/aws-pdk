# Reporting bugs and Feature requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or to suggest features.

When filing an issue,

- Check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already reported the issue.
- Include as much information as you can. For example, details like these are incredibly useful:
    - A reproducible test case or series of steps
    - The version of our code being used (semver)
    - Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
    - Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
